EDA FINDINGS – STUDENT PERFORMANCE DATASET

1. Dataset contains 649 rows and 33 columns.
2. No missing values were found in any column.
3. Numerical features include age, studytime, failures, absences, and grades (G1, G2, G3).
4. Grade variables (G1, G2, G3) show strong positive correlation with each other.
5. Absences show a weak negative correlation with final grade (G3).
6. Outliers were detected using the IQR method, mainly in absences and grade columns.
7. Outliers were capped instead of removed to avoid data loss.
8. Cleaned dataset was exported for further analysis.
